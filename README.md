1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - **Initial Data Review**: The dataset consists of various columns, including the Title, Genre, Rating, Release Date, Country, and Type (Movie/TV Show). Before creating visualizations, the data was carefully explored to understand the structure, identify any null values, and ensure the correct data types for each field. This allowed for efficient cleaning and transformation of the data, ensuring all fields were ready for analysis.

2. **Canvas Background Customization**:

This feature helps create a professional and cohesive design that aligns with the overall branding of the dashboard. The background color was chosen to be subtle yet engaging, ensuring that visualizations stand out clearly.

3. **Field Map Visualization**:
   - A **Map** visualization was created to represent the distribution of Amazon Movies and TV Shows across various countries. This map showcases how content is spread worldwide and highlights regional preferences or content availability. The map uses color saturation to represent metrics like the **number of titles** or **average ratings**, providing a clear view of the content's geographical reach.

These charts allow users to easily compare which genres have higher ratings or which genres are most prominent in the dataset.
